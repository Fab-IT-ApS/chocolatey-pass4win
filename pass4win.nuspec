	<releaseNotes>

	1.1.2:
	
	News:
	I really need translators and validators :-) the process is simple you don't need to know how to code, or to read code. Suggestions are made based on microsoft translate. Translating the entire program costs 10 minutes max after I set you up with access to Crowdin.

	I'm using a lot more services, the build passes the coverity scan, builds are confirmed on travis-ci and unhandled exceptions are now sent through Bugsnag (also used by github for Atom).

	Added:

    Localisation currently in English (default) and Dutch. Depending on your OS settings the language will be chosen
    Password generator
    Toolbar with icons instead of the different buttons
    Exceptions which are not handled will be fetched by Bugsnag
    Search now has a delay of half a second and an autocomplete feature


	1.1.1:
	
	Lot of bugfixes:

    Key matching (on mail address)
    GIT settings
    Minimizes to systray, exit through right click menu

	Changes:

    Installer is only silent when the /S flag is given, otherwise normal
    Config is now handled in a smarter way and will transfer with a new version
	
	1.1.0:
	
	Enhancements:

    Add password doesn't require multiple clicks anymore
    Right click shows a disabled menu if no entry is selected
    Check for a new version and yes even tells you about it when there is a new version

	Bugfixes:

    Checks if the keys defined in .gpg-id are in the gpg keystore before encrypting

	Have fun with it.

	1.0.7:

    Installation is silent now
    Uninstall honors the /S flag
    Added GPL notice to not generated source files
    Added an about form
    added version info
    fixed remote bug on initial config
